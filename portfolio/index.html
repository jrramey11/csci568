     <div class="definition"><font face="Times New Roman" size="+3" color="#ff0000">Data mining</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="-3" color="#657383"> --noun--</font> : the analysis and exploration of data to identify patterns, characteristics, anomalies, and insightful information to serve a desired purpose.</p>
    <div class="introduction"><font face="Times New Roman" size="+1">  In our vast world of information, one resource that was once overlooked as a statistical purpose has begun to emerge with hidden values and relations. Data can virtually be easy to obtain, but the value and relationships that it represents can easily be missed unless one implements the 'Data Mining' approach. Data Mining is an essential concept when it comes to implementing what we have to better prepare for future measures. These implementations can be used in a biological manner to discover hidden genes or relationships among proteins, discover a set of rules in order to safely eat wild mushrooms, and even to help predict what music or movies a user may like that he or she has not seen or heard of yet.</p>
        
        
            The cost of data mining does come with a heavy overhead of concepts and methods. One can not just simply look at the data and expect to get the desired results from the data. Instead, one has to consider the characteristics of the data and how these characteristics, positive or negative, will affect the data mining process and even the results. Once these characteristics have been considered, one can then begin exploring the data and developing sophisticated algorithms to detect relationships and even anomalies. These results can be produced in just terminal out put or for a more general audience a visual representation. The data mining process is a concept that should not be taken lightly as it does require a considerable amount of time from the data scientist to produce quality results. </p></font>
